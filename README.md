# Lolly Sorter

Welcome to this micro repository. 

This repo contains some source code for a small candy sorting machine.  
It was built for a small expo to show what you can do with a few lines of code.  
Since the target audience was children to young adults I needed to have simple to understand soruce code with an environment that allows tinkering, therefore I've implemented everything in micropython.

The code is built for this hardtware: https://diyodemag.com/projects/lolly_sorter


Feel free to do whatever you want :)
